# Bookmarklet password reader

This very little tiny script helps you to put the password already present on the page into an alert

## How I set it up ?

Bookmark manager > add a page > put the reader-utf8.js into the value of this field
That's all, you can now click on the new bookmark when you have a password present but hidden under the bullets :D
